title: "Initial Bike Data Import"
output: github
---
The only data types we needed to change were workingday into a boolean, temp into a long, atemp into a long, hum into a long and windspeed into a long.

Factor Variables: 
- Season (1, 2, 3, 4)
- Year (1, 2)
- Month (1-12)
- Weekday (0-6)


```{r}
bike <- read.csv2("hour.csv", header=TRUE, as.is=TRUE, sep=",")

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
bike$workingday = as.logical(bike$workingday)
bike$temp = as.numeric(bike$temp)
bike$atemp = as.numeric(bike$temp)
bike$hum = as.numeric(bike$hum)
bike$windspeed = as.numeric(bike$windspeed)

bike
```
